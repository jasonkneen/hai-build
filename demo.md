### ✨ Here's what a smarter SDLC looks like:

- 📝 Use [Specifai](https://github.com/presidio-oss/specif-ai) to generate and refine requirements and instantly turn them into tasks
- 💻 Let [Amazon Q](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.amazon-q-vscode) convert those tasks into working code with the help of [Specifai MCP Server](https://github.com/presidio-oss/specifai-mcp-server)
- ✅ Track everything with [Jira](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Atlassian-Remote-MCP-Server-beta-now-available-for-desktop/ba-p/3022084) from your IDE!
- 📚 Document as you go in [Confluence](https://community.atlassian.com/forums/Atlassian-Platform-articles/Atlassian-Remote-MCP-Server-beta-now-available-for-desktop/ba-p/3022084) right from your IDE!
- 🧪 Use [Factifai](https://github.com/presidio-oss/factif-ai) to visually test and validate your implementation
